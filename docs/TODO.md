# TODO

### Obvious Next Steps
1. Do a hand of cards per player with existing 6 slot board
2. Do player specific actions, so don't show opponent cards, and don't let them be dragged
3. Fill out rest of board slots, and only let players put cards in their slot
4. Do a draw pile

### Things That Came Up While Developing
- On first visiting the page load any existing game state (likely part of the public lobby work)
- Better cache busting strategy for ensuring fresh resources from the server side on a redeploy
- Dynamic page header based on local vs live deploy env
